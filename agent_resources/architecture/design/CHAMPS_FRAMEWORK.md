## Overview

CHAMPS is an AI-powered tagging system that generates clear, actionable success criteria for micro-steps in task management. Adapted from Randy Sprick's classroom management framework, CHAMPS provides structure and clarity specifically optimized for ADHD brains.

### What Makes CHAMPS Different?

Traditional task management systems focus on WHAT you need to do. CHAMPS focuses on:
- **HOW** to do it (Activity)
- **WHERE** you need to be (Movement)
- **WHAT ENERGY** it requires (Participation)
- **WHEN** you'll need help (Help)
- **WHO** you'll interact with (Conversation)
- **HOW YOU'LL KNOW** you're done (Success)

### Core Principle

> **Clear expectations reduce cognitive load and anxiety, enabling ADHD brains to start and complete tasks more effectively.**

---

## Why CHAMPS?

### The ADHD Challenge

ADHD brains struggle with:
1. **Task Initiation**: "I don't know where to start"
2. **Working Memory**: "What was I supposed to be doing?"
3. **Sustained Attention**: "How much longer will this take?"
4. **Completion Uncertainty**: "Am I done? Did I do it right?"
5. **Context Switching**: "This task requires different energy than I have"

### The CHAMPS Solution

By providing explicit answers to six key questions, CHAMPS removes ambiguity and reduces the cognitive load required to:
- **Start** a task (clear expectations)
- **Maintain** focus (known duration/energy)
- **Complete** successfully (clear success criteria)
- **Choose** the right task for the moment (context matching)

### Research Foundation

The classroom CHAMPS framework has demonstrated:
- **Improved concentration** in students with ADHD
- **Increased task completion** rates
- **Reduced anxiety** around task expectations
- **Better time-on-task** performance

**Source**: Randomized controlled trial with 102 teachers and 1,450 middle school students (Sprick et al.)

---

## The Six Dimensions

### 1. 💬 Conversation

**Question**: What level of talking/interaction is needed?

**Purpose**: Helps users understand if they can do this task while:
- In a quiet library (no conversation)
- During a meeting (requires communication)
- While on a call (multitasking)
- Alone without interruption

**Tag Examples**:
- 💬 Communication - Active talking/writing to others
- 🤔 Decision - Internal thinking, no external conversation
- ❓ Clarification - May need to ask questions
- 🔇 Silent - Complete silence required
- 👥 Collaboration - Group discussion needed

**Use Cases**:
- Filter out "Communication" tasks when in a loud environment
- Find "Silent" tasks when you need to be on mute in a meeting
- Batch "Collaboration" tasks for team time

---

### 2. 🆘 Help

**Question**: How do I get help if stuck?

**Purpose**: Reduces anxiety by clarifying:
- What can go wrong?
- How to verify you're doing it right
- When to save progress
- Where to find resources

**Tag Examples**:
- 💾 Save Progress - Checkpoint opportunities available
- ✅ Verify - Built-in validation/checking
- 📋 Organize - Requires categorization/sorting
- 🔍 Research - May need to look things up
- ⚙️ Configuration - Settings or setup required

**Use Cases**:
- Prioritize "Save Progress" tasks when time is limited
- Avoid tasks without "Verify" when accuracy is critical
- Batch "Research" tasks when you have good internet

---

### 3. 🎬 Activity

**Question**: What am I actually doing?

**Purpose**: Provides concrete action clarity:
- Physical vs. digital actions
- The TYPE of work (writing, reading, moving, creating)
- Preparation requirements

**Tag Examples**:
- ⬆️ Transfer - Moving data/files between systems
- ⬇️ Download - Receiving/acquiring content
- 🧹 Clean - Tidying, organizing, deleting
- 👨‍🍳 Prepare - Getting ready, setup work
- 🛒 Purchase - Buying/acquiring items
- 📝 Write - Creating written content
- 📖 Read - Consuming information
- 🎨 Create - Making something new

**Use Cases**:
- Batch all "Transfer" tasks together
- Do "Clean" tasks when procrastinating harder work
- Save "Create" tasks for peak creative energy

---

### 4. 🚶 Movement

**Question**: Can I move around or stay in place?

**Purpose**: Matches tasks to physical context:
- Stuck at desk? Find stationary tasks
- Running errands? Find travel tasks
- Feeling restless? Find movement tasks

**Tag Examples**:
- 🚗 Travel - Requires transportation
- 🚶 Move - Walking/physical movement
- 🪑 Stationary - Desk/seated work
- 🏠 Home - Must be at home
- 🏢 Office - Must be at workplace
- 🌍 Location-Specific - Requires specific place

**Use Cases**:
- Filter "Stationary" when sitting at desk
- Find "Travel" tasks when planning errands
- Choose "Move" tasks when feeling antsy/hyperactive

---

### 5. ⚡ Participation

**Question**: What does success look like? (Energy Level)

**Purpose**: Matches task demands to current energy/attention capacity:
- Low energy → Quick Wins
- Medium energy → Focused tasks
- High energy → Sustained/Endurance tasks

**Tag Examples**:
- ⚡ Quick Win - 2 minutes or less, instant gratification
- 🎯 Focused - 3-5 minutes, single task attention
- ⏱️ Sustained - 6-15 minutes, continuous focus
- 🏃 Endurance - 16-30 minutes, prolonged effort
- 🏔️ Marathon - 30+ minutes, deep work session

**Energy-Attention Matrix**:
```
Energy    | Quick Win | Focused | Sustained | Endurance | Marathon
----------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|----------
Very Low  |    ✅     |   ⚠️    |    ❌     |    ❌     |    ❌
Low       |    ✅     |   ✅    |    ⚠️    |    ❌     |    ❌
Medium    |    ✅     |   ✅    |    ✅     |    ⚠️    |    ❌
High      |    ✅     |   ✅    |    ✅     |    ✅     |    ⚠️
Peak      |    ✅     |   ✅    |    ✅     |    ✅     |    ✅
```

**Use Cases**:
- Morning: Start with Quick Wins for dopamine boost
- Low energy: Filter for Quick Wins only
- Peak hours: Tackle Marathon tasks
- Before break: Finish Focused tasks

**ADHD Insight**: Quick Wins provide immediate dopamine hits, creating momentum for harder tasks.

---

### 6. ✅ Success

**Question**: What are the completion criteria?

**Purpose**: Removes ambiguity about when you're "done":
- Clear finish line
- Observable completion state
- Validation that it worked

**Tag Examples**:
- 🎯 Complete - Binary done state (all or nothing)
- ✅ Selected - Making a choice
- 💾 Saved - Data persisted successfully
- 📋 Organized - Items categorized/sorted
- ✅ Verified - Checked and confirmed
- 📤 Sent - Delivered/transmitted
- 📥 Received - Acquired/downloaded
- 🗑️ Deleted - Removed/cleaned

**Use Cases**:
- Prefer "Complete" tasks when you need clear wins
- Choose "Verified" tasks when accuracy matters
- Avoid ambiguous success criteria when tired

---

## How It Works

### 1. Tag Generation Pipeline

```
User captures task: "Buy groceries for the week"
        ↓
Task decomposed into micro-steps by DecomposerAgent
        ↓
For each micro-step:
    1. Extract: description, estimated_minutes, leaf_type
    2. Call CHAMPSTagService.generate_tags()
    3. LLM analyzes step context
    4. Returns CHAMPS tags for all 6 dimensions
    5. Tags stored in micro_steps.tags (JSON array)
        ↓
Tags displayed in UI, used for filtering/analytics
```

### 2. LLM Prompt Strategy

The CHAMPS service uses a specialized prompt that:
- Explains each dimension with examples
- Provides emoji-based tag vocabulary
- Considers step duration for Participation tags
- Considers leaf_type (DIGITAL vs HUMAN) for Activity tags
- Generates 2-4 tags per dimension
- Includes reasoning and confidence score

**Example LLM Output**:
```json
{
  "conversation": ["💬 Communication"],
  "help": ["✅ Verify", "📋 Organize"],
  "activity": ["🛒 Purchase", "🚗 Travel"],
  "movement": ["🚗 Travel", "🚶 Move"],
  "participation": ["⏱️ Sustained"],
  "success": ["🎯 Complete", "📥 Received"],
  "reasoning": "Grocery shopping requires travel, physical movement, communication with checkout, sustained focus (15 min), and clear completion (items acquired)",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
```

### 3. Fallback System

If LLM generation fails:
- Keyword-based tag generation
- Duration-based Participation tags
- Safe default tags per dimension
- Confidence score reduced to 0.6

## Implementation Architecture

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Existing table (already implemented)
CREATE TABLE micro_steps (
    step_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    parent_task_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    step_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    estimated_minutes INTEGER NOT NULL,
    icon TEXT,
    short_label TEXT,
    leaf_type TEXT DEFAULT 'HUMAN',
    delegation_mode TEXT DEFAULT 'DO',
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'TODO',
    tags TEXT,  -- JSON array of CHAMPS tags
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_task_id) REFERENCES tasks(task_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_micro_steps_tags ON micro_steps(tags);
```

### Service Architecture

- Confidence scoring

**MicroStepService** ([src/services/micro_step_service.py](src/services/micro_step_service.py)):
- Integrates CHAMPSTagService
- Auto-generates tags on step creation
- Provides tag retrieval APIs

**DecomposerAgent** ([src/agents/decomposer_agent.py](src/agents/decomposer_agent.py)):
- Calls CHAMPS generation during decomposition
- Ensures all micro-steps have tags

### Data Models

```python
class CHAMPSTags(BaseModel):
    conversation: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    help: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    activity: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    movement: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    participation: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    success: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)

    def get_all_tags(self) -> List[str]:
        """Flatten all tags into single list"""
        return (self.conversation + self.help + self.activity +
                self.movement + self.participation + self.success)

class CHAMPSTagResult(BaseModel):
    tags: CHAMPSTags
    reasoning: str
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)
```

## Personalization & Intelligence

### User CHAMPS Profile

Track individual patterns:
- **Preferred Participation Levels**: "I like Quick Wins (85% preference)"
- **Energy Patterns**: "Peak energy 9-11am, low 2-4pm"
- **Context Availability**: "Stationary tasks M/W/F, Travel tasks Tu/Th"
- **Success Rates by Tag**: "90% completion on Quick Wins, 40% on Marathon"

### Smart Recommendations

**Energy-Matched Task Queue**:
```
Current State: Low energy (2/5)
Recommended Tasks:
1. ⚡ Reply to email (Quick Win, Stationary, 2 min)
2. ⚡ Upload photo (Quick Win, Stationary, 1 min)
3. 🎯 Review doc (Focused, Stationary, 5 min)

Avoid Right Now:
- 🏔️ Write proposal (Marathon, 45 min) - Needs high energy
- 🚗 Grocery shopping (Travel, 20 min) - You're at desk
```

**Context-Aware Batching**:
```
You have 4 🚗 Travel tasks:
- Bank deposit
- Mail package
- Buy milk
- Return library books

Suggested route: Bank → Post office → Grocery → Library (saves 15 min)
```

### Learning System

Track completion data to improve:
1. **Success Prediction**: "You have 72% chance of completing this based on past Marathon tasks"
2. **Optimal Timing**: "You complete Communication tasks 60% better at 10am vs 3pm"
3. **Energy Calibration**: "When you say 'Medium energy', you complete Focused tasks but not Sustained"
4. **Intervention Triggers**: "You abandon 80% of Marathon tasks - want to break them down?"
