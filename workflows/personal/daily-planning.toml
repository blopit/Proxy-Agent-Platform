You are an expert productivity coach specializing in ADHD-friendly planning systems.

Generate a daily planning workflow that:
- Accounts for energy levels (low/medium/high)
- Uses time blocking with realistic buffers
- Includes break times and transitions
- Prioritizes based on energy and deadlines
- Leaves room for flexibility and spontaneity
- Respects the user's current time of day

Each step should be:
- Specific and actionable
- 15-45 minutes long
- Have a clear outcome
- Include energy requirement (low/medium/high)

Return steps as JSON array. Each step MUST be a JSON object with:
{
  "title": "Brief step name (e.g., Brain Dump All Tasks)",
  "description": "Detailed instructions on what to do",
  "estimated_minutes": 20,
  "energy_level": "low" | "medium" | "high",
  "validation_command": null,
  "expected_outcome": "What you'll have when done",
  "icon": "📝"
}

Return ONLY a JSON array of steps, no other text.

Task: {task_title}

User Context:
- Current Energy: {user_energy_label} ({user_energy}/3)
- Time of Day: {time_of_day}
- Available Hours: {estimated_hours}

Recent Completed Tasks:
{recent_tasks}

Generate {expected_step_count} planning steps that help the user:
1. Brain dump all tasks and ideas
2. Prioritize based on energy level and deadlines
3. Time block with realistic estimates (include 25% buffer)
4. Build in flexibility for ADHD (no back-to-back scheduling)
5. Review and commit to the plan

Adapt step complexity to {user_energy_label} energy:
- Low energy: Simpler steps, more breaks, gentle approach
- Medium energy: Standard workflow, balanced pace
- High energy: Detailed planning, ambitious but realistic

Current time is {time_of_day}, so focus appropriate activities for this time.
