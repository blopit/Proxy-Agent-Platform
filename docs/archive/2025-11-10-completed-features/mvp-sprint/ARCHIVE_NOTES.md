   - Phase 2: Service layer refactor
   - Phase 3: API improvements
   - Detailed task breakdowns with hour estimates

## Why Archived

- **Completed work**: MVP sprint finished in January 2025
- **Superseded**: Current platform has evolved significantly beyond this MVP
- **Mobile-first migration**: Oct 2025 migration to Expo changed architecture
- **Current status**: See docs/status/CURRENT_STATUS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md for latest

## Potentially Useful Information

### For Historical Context
- **Original MVP scope**: Shows what was considered "core" in Jan 2025
- **Simplification philosophy**: Documents reducing complexity for ADHD users
- **API evolution**: Shows how endpoints evolved from MVP to current

### For Backend Agents
- **Energy API**: Simple 3-level energy tracking implementation (may still be relevant pattern)
- **Focus API**: Pure Pomodoro timer implementation
- **Database patterns**: Early Alembic/SQLAlchemy patterns

### Extract Before Deleting
If planning to delete this archive:
1. ✅ Simple energy tracking pattern (1-3 selector) - may be valuable for UX
2. ✅ Pomodoro implementation - check if current focus system uses this
3. ✅ MVP simplification principles - valuable for future feature decisions

## Current Equivalent Documentation

- **Current Platform Status**: docs/status/CURRENT_STATUS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md
- **Current Architecture**: docs/architecture/system-overview.md
- **Current API**: docs/backend/API_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md
- **Mobile Architecture**: docs/mobile/ (Expo-based, Oct 2025+)

**Action**: Safe to keep archived. Review if planning major simplification or returning to MVP approach.
